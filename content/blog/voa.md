[00:00:04] welcome to learning English a daily 30 minute program from The Voice of America I'm Katie Weaver and I'm Mario
[00:00:14] Ritter JR this program is designed for English Learners so we speak a little slower and we use words and
[00:00:23] phrases especially written for people learning English
[00:00:32] on today's program Katie tells the story of the Golden Gate Bridge John Russell and Jill Robbins give advice on
[00:00:42] physical therapists Andrew Smith reports on scientists predictions about the next ice age here Dorothy Gundy tell about a new
[00:00:54] medical device that could help disabled people walk then the lesson of the day but first every day more than
[00:01:08] 10,000 automobiles cross a historic and beautiful bridge in Northern California the span is called the Golden Gate Bridge it
[00:01:22] is named after the body of water below it the Golden Gate straight connects the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco
[00:01:33] Bay The Bridge links the city of San Francisco with Marin County to the north Joseph Strauss was the chief
[00:01:46] engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge Building began in 1933 the bridge was opened for use in 1937 the distance
[00:02:02] between the main Towers is almost 1,300 M long that was the longest suspension bridge Span in the world for
[00:02:16] almost 30 years then in 1964 the larger verzano Narrows Bridge opened in New York City today the Akashi Kio
[00:02:33] bridge in Japan has the longest span Strauss used newly developed protective equipment for the men who worked on the
[00:02:45] bridge these included a special safety net under the bridge but still 11 workers fell to their death during the
[00:02:58] building project the color of the bridge International Orange is very important it was chosen partly because it is easier
[00:03:12] to see through the heavy fog that often covers San Francisco many people consider the Golden Gate Bridge the most
[03:03:25] beautiful Bridge of its kind in the world more than two billion vehicles have crossed the bridge since its opening
[03:03:37] but wheels are not the only way to cross the bridge the Golden Gate is also open to Walkers many
[03:03:48] people walk across each year and there is no cost to do so on clear days the bridge provides excellent
[03:04:00] fuse of San Francisco ships down below and birds all around Strauss wrote a poem about his bridge when the
[03:04:12] work was completed here is part of the mighty task is done at last the mighty task is done resplendant
[04:04:27] in the Western Sun the bridge looms Mountain High its Titan peers grip ocean floor its great steel arms link
[04:04:40] Shore with Shore its Towers pierce the sky I'm Katie Weaver
[04:04:58] many of us might only seek out physical therapists if we are recovering from accidental injuries or surgery however medical
[05:05:10] experts say these Specialists can also help prevent many health problems if they are seen on a regular basis one
[05:05:21] leader in the industry Sharon Dunn even calls physical therapists the best kept secret in in healthcare Dunn is the
[05:05:32] past president of the American Physical Therapy Association AA she recently told the Associated Press she thinks people need to
[05:05:45] look at physical therapists in a new way as health practitioners who can help identify possible medical issues before they
[05:05:57] appear other health experts share this opinion they include Roger Herr the current president of the AA and gamon aart
[06:06:10] of Washington University in St Louis they both shared dun's prevention message in separate discussions with the AP aart urges
[06:06:22] people to think about physical therapists just as they do dentists even if you're not having any problem you go
[06:06:31] in and have everything checked out she noted that such examinations could help find and deal with problems early for
[06:06:43] example an exam could include a patient's health history and current health things like physical activity sleep nutrition and so
[06:06:54] on this could be followed by a look at how a person is moving exams might uncover things like postural
[07:07:03] issues or unusual body movements her is a big supporter of yearly Wellness visits he told the AP he believes
[07:07:16] physical therapists can be helpful for all kinds of people the young athletes or anyone who wants to be as
[07:07:25] independent as possible in the United States you can now visit a physical therapist in all 50 states without needing
[07:07:36] permission from a doctor or surgeon however a yearly exam might not be covered by a person's health insurance this
[07:07:47] could prevent some from seeking out care aart estimated such a visit in areas across the US Midwest might cost
[07:07:58] around $150 her suggested a cost of $200 to $300 in more costly areas but both experts said that in
[08:08:13] the long run such exams might save money and can add healthy years I think if people understood more that
[08:08:24] the way they move might be setting them up for a problem down the line they'd be much more inclined
[08:08:32] to see a physical therapist aart said we are all built differently so it might be useful to examine children
[08:08:41] early to see what sports or activities might be good for them physical therapists can carry out such early exams
[08:08:51] aart said if we screened kids as they were choosing Sports and said this sport is probably not the right
[08:08:58] kind of stress for the way you are put together it could save a lot of pain and problems down
[09:09:05] the line she added about children maybe they don't have the hips for ballet distance Runners could also think this
[09:09:14] way some are built to avoid injuries despite running many kilometers While others are not exams by physical therapists could
[09:09:25] help identify future problems another area where physical therapists can help is with fall prevention falling and the fear of
[09:09:38] falling can be major issues especially for the Aging population you want to show people they can get back up
[09:09:48] if they fall her said and once they know they can do it it gives them confidence and it can
[09:09:57] help reduce the fear of falling he added one of the risks of falling is that people don't do anything
[10:10:06] so you don't move and therefore you become more out of shape her said one example could be to introduce
[10:10:15] exercises involving floor toand movements these can help improve flexibility strength balance coordination and planning it sounds simple getting up
[10:10:31] from a lying position on the floor to stand her said but it's a great exercise for all age groups
[10:10:41] aart estimated about half of physical therapy patients seek help to deal with issues related to being overweight the more
[10:10:51] weight somebody is carrying the higher the loads are on their joints she said her said he had watched extremely
[11:11:01] overweight patients successfully lose large amounts of weight he noted that some of these individuals are motivated for a specific
[11:11:12] reason but for others it is not always that clear and easy I have seen people change based on a
[11:11:21] milestone like having a kid and they really want to be a good parent her said they want to be
[11:11:30] a fit parent and the same thing with a grandparent so that motivates people to engage because of a lifestyle
[11:11:39] change I'm John Russell and I'm Jill Robbins
[11:11:55] a recent study suggests the next ice age will likely begin in about 11,000 years unless emissions change the effects
[12:12:05] of natural climate Cycles an ice age is a period of reduced temperatures causing ice to cover large areas of
[12:12:15] the northern and southern parts of the world a group of scientists studied changes in the shape of the Earth's
[12:12:25] orbit around the Sun the tilt of the Earth's axis and the movement of the axis itself called a wobble
[12:12:36] these three motions are believed to happen in Cycles the Serbian scientist bulletine banovich developed a theory about 100 years
[12:12:48] ago that these Cycles affected Earth's longterm climate the team noted that small changes in Earth's orbit around the sun
[13:13:01] caused predictable cycles of warming and cooling over a period of about 100,000 years these findings permitted the team to
[13:13:13] determine how the three factors of tilt wobble and the shape of Earth's orbit might have affected the earth's climate
[13:13:25] over the last 900,000 years the group published its findings in science on February 27th the scientists examined a million-year
[13:13:39] record of climate by looking at ice sheets across the northern half of the world and deep ocean temperatures they
[13:13:50] then compared this data with small but regular changes in Earth's orbit over time the lead writer of the study
[14:14:01] is Steven Barker a professor at Cardiff University in Britain he told the French news agency AFP that for many
[14:14:13] years it has been difficult for scientists to show exactly how small changes in Earth's orbit have led to huge
[14:14:23] changes between warm and cold periods Earth is believ to go through cycles of ice ages and warm periods the
[14:14:35] last ice age is thought to have ended around 11,700 years ago scientists such as malanovich have long seen a
[14:14:47] connection between Earth's orbit and climate however researchers have struggled to precisely date when each of the climate changes happened
[15:15:01] it has also been difficult for them to know exactly which orbit positions affect the start and stop of cold
[15:15:10] or warm periods Barker said his team of researchers studied slow changes in temperature over long periods of time instead
[15:15:22] of only looking at shorter periods of change between cold and warm climates Barker told AFP we would expect a
[15:15:33] glaciation to occur within the next 11,000 years and it would end in 66,000 years time laoren liziki is a
[15:15:46] professor at the University of California Santa Barbara and a co-writer of the study she said the study shows that
[15:15:57] changes in climate over tens of thousands of years are not random the team aims to expand its findings to
[16:16:08] investigate the long-term effects of human activity on climate they also want to find out how it might affect Earth's
[16:16:18] natural climate Cycles I'm Andrew Smith
[16:16:38] researchers recently reported new evidence from a study of a medical device placed inside the body a spine stimulating implant
[16:16:51] three people with a muscle destroying disease got a little stronger after using the implant they were able to stand
[17:17:03] and walk more easily because of electrical stimulation to their spinal cord Marco capogrosso is an assistant professor at the
[17:17:17] University of Pittsburgh or pit who led the research these people were definitely not expecting an improvement he said keago
[17:17:31] said they were getting better and better over the study that lasted 1 month the implant was able to return
[17:17:42] some muscle function at least temporarily the implant was already being tested to treat paralysis in other patients this new
[17:17:56] evidence suggests it might also Aid diseases of the nervous system like spinal muscle atrophy or SM SMA is a
[18:18:10] genetic disease that slowly destroys motor neurons nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscles that leads muscles to
[18:18:23] waste away especially in the legs hips and shoulders and sometimes those involved with breathing and swallowing there is no
[18:18:36] cure a gene therapy can save the lives of very young children with a severe form of the disease and
[18:18:46] there are some medicines to slow the disease in older patients stimulating the spinal cord with low levels of electricity
[18:18:58] has has long been used to treat chronic or long-term pain Capo's team also has tested it to help people
[19:19:09] Paralyzed by Strokes or spinal cord injury move their arms and legs with assistance the system sends electrical signals to
[19:19:21] nerves that have stopped reacting this has the effect of activating the muscles capago wondered if that same technology might
[19:19:34] help patients with SMA by stimulating sensory nerves to Signal damaged muscle cells causing them to move the researchers at
[19:19:47] the University of Pittsburgh published their study in nature medicine I'm Dorothy Gundy
[20:00:04] hello my name is Anna Mato and I'm Andrew Smith my name is Jill Robbins you're listening to the lesson
[00:20:16] of the day on the learning English podcast welcome to the part of the show where we help you do
[00:20:23] more with our series let's learn English the series shows Anna Mato in her work and life in Washington D.C

[02:03:12] help I did she uses a modal verb would as she asks would you be able to come downtown please
[02:03:24] this sentence pattern is common when we feel we might be asking someone to make a big effort to help
[02:03:30] us when we ask would you be able to we are being very polite and giving the other person a
[02:03:38] chance to say no we could say that we are afraid we might be imposing that's spelled i m p
[02:03:51] o s i n imposing on someone by making a request for something like borrowing money to impose is to
[04:04:05] expect someone to do more than you usually ask them to do another phrase we use if we feel we
[04:04:12] are imposing on someone is would you do me a favor let's listen to find out how Anna asks her
[04:04:20] other friends for help listen for a modal verb hi Jonathan how's it going hey Anna things are great what's

[04:04:59] by I'm Andrew Smith and you're listening to the lesson of the day on the learning English podcast did you
[05:05:08] hear a modal verb listeners we hear Anna using another modal verb could when she asks Jonathan to give her
[05:05:18] some money like would the modal verb could softens the request and makes it more polite well I was wondering
[05:05:29] if you could give me some money Jonathan uses could two times when he answers Anna I wish I could
[05:05:43] I'm at the airport with my mother her flight leaves in 2 hours that's okay tell your mom to have
[05:05:51] a nice trip I do wish I could help thanks bye so so everyone is being polite but Anna is
[06:06:01] still stuck without any money there's one more thing about the language we hear in this lesson Anna says well
[06:06:10] I was wondering if you could give me some money we use Wonder in polite questions like this Andrew I

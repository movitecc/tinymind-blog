#### 2.1.1 Peripherals

>  **Peripherals** are the chip's connections to the outside world, like its doors and windows. They allow the chip to interact with other devices, receive input, and send output. Think of them as the communication specialists of the chip.

#### 2.2.1 Aspect ratio

> Aspect ratio is expressed as a ratio of width to height. For example:
>
> - **1:1** means the block is a perfect square—its width and height are equal.
> - **2:1** means the block is twice as wide as it is tall.
> - **1:2** means the block is twice as tall as it is wide.

> Why does aspect ratio matter in chip design?
>
> - **Space Efficiency:** Some blocks, like memory arrays, are naturally suited to tall, narrow shapes. Others, like processing units, might work better in a more square configuration. Choosing the right aspect ratio helps you fit everything together efficiently.
> - **Routing:** The shape of a block affects how easily you can connect it to other blocks. Long, narrow blocks can create challenges for routing wires.
> - **Performance:** Sometimes, the aspect ratio can influence signal delays within a block. A very long, thin block might have longer signal paths, leading to slower operation.

#### 2.2.2 power consumption

> Power consumption is measured in **watts (W)**. Higher wattage means the block uses more power. Here's why you need to pay close attention to this:
>
> - **Battery Life:** For mobile devices, lower power consumption is essential for extending battery life.
> - **Heat Dissipation:** Power consumed by a block is converted into heat. Too much heat can damage the chip and reduce its lifespan. Effective heat management is crucial.
> - **Performance:** Sometimes, high-performance blocks require more power. There's often a trade-off between performance and power consumption.
> - **Cost:** Chips that consume less power are generally more cost-effective to manufacture and operate.

#### 2.2.3 connectivity

> When defining a block's connectivity, you need to determine:
>
> - **What other blocks does it need to communicate with?** This depends on its functionality and its role in the overall chip design. For example, a CPU needs to connect to memory to fetch instructions and data.
> - **What type of signals are exchanged?** These could be data signals, control signals, clock signals, or power signals.
> - **How many connections are required?** This depends on the amount of data that needs to be transferred and the speed of communication. A high-bandwidth interface might require multiple parallel connections.
> - **What are the communication protocols?** This defines the rules and timing for data exchange. Common protocols include AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface), APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus), and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
>
> Connectivity plays a significant role in determining the overall performance, area, and power consumption of the chip. Efficient communication between blocks is crucial for smooth operation and optimal performance. During floorplanning, designers need to carefully consider the placement of blocks and the routing of interconnections to minimize signal delays and congestion.
